# Advanced CSS-SASS Course Progression

Documenting my progress of the course [Advanced CSS-SASS Course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/) on Udemy.

##### New Concepts to Focus:
* SASS
* Using Sass in real-world projects: global variables, architecting CSS, managing media queries, etc.
* CSS Architecture (component-based design, BEM, writing reusable code, etc).
* Advanced CSS animations with @keyframes, animation and transition.
* CSS Grid layouts: build a huge real-world project with CSS Grid.
* Advanced responsive design: media queries, mobile-first vs desktop-first, em vs rem units, etc.
* Flexbox layouts: build a huge real-world project with flexbox.
